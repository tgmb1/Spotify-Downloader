### Why do I get a 403 Forbidden error in my logs?
> Your VPS/Local Server might be blocked by YouTube. Try changing the IP address or using a proxy by filling the `FIXIE_SOCKS_HOST` variable, changing the location, or using cookies. Add this line ["cookiefile":"path"](https://github.com/Masterolic/Spotify-Downloader/blob/fe859965e62a5ca8f29fc69185cd132d456e4bfd/mbot/utils/mainhelper.py#L144) where `path` is defined as where your cookie file is. Refer [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubedl/wiki/cookies/) for more details.

## Note
> This is the old repository of [@Spotify_downloa_bot](https://t.me/Spotify_downloa_bot), so it may be buggy and lack some features. However, it will still be maintained and updated with new features as they are developed.

## Technical Details

### Which language and Telegram API are used?
> This bot is created using Python and the pyrogram library for Telegram.

### Why is this open source?
> I don't own this repo; this is an edited version of [@NeedMusicRobot](https://t.me/NeedMusicRobot).

### Is this source code used for [@Spotify_downloa_bot](https://t.me/Spotify_downloa_bot)?
> No, this [bot](https://github.com/rozari0/NeedMusicRobot) was the inspiration to build our bot. You can see our bot is entirely different, and some features will be implemented in this repository.
